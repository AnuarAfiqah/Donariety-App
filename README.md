# Donariety-App
This is an app created for the sole of completing Mobile App assignment in my university.
It is solely for testing our capability of using Android Studio.
If it seems simple, it's probably because of the requirements of the assignment:
1. Project must contain, a maximum of 3 activities only.
2. The project must be related to one of the 13 Sustainable Development Goals.
