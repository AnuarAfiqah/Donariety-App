# Donariety-App
This is an app created for the sole of completing Mobile App assignment in my university.
It is solely for testing our capability of using Android Studio.
If it seems simple, it's probably because of the requirements of the assignment:
1. Project must contain, a maximum of 3 activities only.
2. The project must be related to one of the 13 Sustainable Development Goals.

An app that is develop in hope of reaching one of the global goals which is zero hunger. This app will allow big business company such as Tesco to update their product (exp: closed to expiring date product) into the app as charity. User that is in need, can search for any branch that is close to them and gets update on the available product.
